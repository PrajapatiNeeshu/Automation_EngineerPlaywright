Perfect — you’ve shared a Playwright E2E Framework structure diagram. I’ll break it down in a clear and practical way so you understand:


What each folder does 🗂️


What kind of files go inside 📄


How it all fits together ⚙️


Where and how you can make updates 🔄



⚙️ Overview
Playwright E2E (End-to-End) Framework is used to test full web applications — from frontend UI to APIs — to make sure everything works correctly together in real-world conditions.
This structure is production-ready, meaning it’s suitable for live CI/CD pipelines (like GitHub Actions or Jenkins) and multiple environments (Dev, QA, Staging, Production).

🗂 Folder-by-Folder Explanation
1. .github/workflows/
File: ci.yml


💡 Purpose: Defines the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.


🧩 What it does:


Automates test execution on each commit/pull request


Sends test reports to CI tools (like Jenkins or GitHub Actions)




🔄 Updates you can make:


Add new testing jobs or conditions


Change triggers (run tests only on main branch or for PRs)





2. config/
Files:


playwright.dev.config.ts


playwright.qa.config.ts


playwright.stg.config.ts


💡 Purpose: Define configuration for different environments (Dev, QA, Staging, Prod).


🧩 Includes:


Base URLs


Browser options


Timeouts


Authentication tokens




🔄 Updates you can make:


Add new environment configs (like prod.config.ts)


Update base URL or test timeout based on environment





3. tests/
Subfolders: smoke/, regression/, critical-path/, api-tests/


💡 Purpose: Store all your actual test scripts.


🧩 Each folder:


Smoke Tests: Quick, high-level tests to check major features


Regression Tests: Full coverage to ensure no new bugs appear


Critical-Path Tests: Key workflows that must never break (like login, checkout)


API Tests: Direct testing of backend endpoints




🔄 Updates you can make:


Add new .spec.ts files for new features


Update existing tests if workflows change





4. pages/
Files:


base-page.ts


login-page.ts


dashboard-page.ts


💡 Purpose: Implements Page Object Model (POM) — a structured way to reuse UI actions.


🧩 Each file:


base-page.ts: Shared utilities (navigation, waits, screenshots)


login-page.ts: Locators and actions for login page


dashboard-page.ts: Locators and actions for dashboard or home page




🔄 Updates you can make:


Add new pages when app grows


Update selectors when UI changes





5. components/
Example: header-component.ts


💡 Purpose: Reusable UI components (like modals, headers, or sidebars).


🧩 Used across multiple pages.


🔄 Updates you can make:


Add new reusable UI parts


Update when component structure changes





6. fixtures/
Files: auth-fixture.ts, user-fixture.ts, etc.


💡 Purpose: Manage setup and teardown for tests.


🧩 Used to:


Authenticate users before tests


Seed test data


Reuse environment setup




🔄 Updates you can make:


Add new fixtures for roles (admin, guest)


Change data seeding logic





7. utils/
Purpose: Utility helpers for API calls, logging, DB, mocks


🧩 Example:


api-helper.ts: reusable HTTP requests


db-utils.ts: read/write to test database


logger.ts: structured logging




🔄 Updates: Add or modify helper functions to simplify test code.



8. test-data/
Files: .json or .ts


💡 Purpose: Store static data for tests — users, inputs, config sets.


🔄 Updates: Add new test data sets or environment-specific data.



9. reports/


💡 Purpose: Store generated HTML or JSON reports after each run.


🧩 Tools: Playwright built-in reporter or Allure reports.


🔄 Updates: Configure report styles or archiving in CI.



10. interceptors/


💡 Purpose: Mock network calls or intercept requests/responses for validation.


🔄 Updates: Add mocks for new endpoints.



11. model/
File: modelware.ts


💡 Purpose: Define models (TypeScript interfaces) for test data and API payloads.


🔄 Updates: Keep models aligned with your backend API schema.

Would you like me to generate a ready-to-use Playwright E2E framework template (folder + sample files) you can directly clone or download from GitHub?
I can build that structure for you next.
